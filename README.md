# Letter-NumMatch
User enters input and the program will check to see if any of the inputs start with a letter and end with a number. The program will then display the number of results that match that format.

What I Learned:
- Check for matches within text string using a regular expression
- Add the matches to a list
- Count the number of items within a list and return that number
